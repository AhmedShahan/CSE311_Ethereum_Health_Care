## Introduction  
<p align="justify">
Nowadays, the medical industry is one of the prominent sectors with a manual system for managing and maintaining critical information. Current medical systems require numerous paper forms, with data stories spread throughout the medical management infrastructure. However, manually sorting out all information and managing all data is tough since all of this data must be maintained on paper and can be lost at any time. Furthermore, manually adding, removing, or altering data is time-consuming and challenging. 
It's quite challenging to merge all the medical history of a patient. In the same way, a patient who faces many times has to search for their desired doctor, and also, it's a big issue to make appointments. Ethereum Health Care ensures maximum flexibility to take over that kind of issue.

## Project Details  
---
<p align="justify">
Ethereum Health Care tries to tackle several problems and make it easy to update data. There 
will also be a few administrative areas where all medical information (doctors and patients) will 
be  preserved  and  handled,  and  a  few  sections  for  doctors  and  patients  to  manage  their 
information and other essential data. For example, if a doctor changes or moves their schedule, it 
will take some time to search the doctor's information and then update it again in a new paper 
form, which will waste time overall. However, this sort of problem can be fixed within a few 
seconds using this application. Furthermore, there is a considerable risk of losing data while 
working manually, but there is no risk of losing data when working with software because the 
data is safely stored in the database.
The actual purpose of this project is to computerize the front office Management of Patient and 
Doctor management systems to develop user-friendly, simple, fast and cost-effective software. It 
deals with patient and doctor information collection, basic ideas about the test and imaging, and 
a brief overview of the doctors. Multiple security features are always our priority, which is also 
our challenge to ensure satisfactory security systems
