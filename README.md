Ethereum Health Care Management Systems focused on the connection between a doctor and a patient. In the present situation of Bangladesh, if any patient wants to make an appointment with a doctor, we always face many difficulties and many times, many patients are unable to reach their desired consultant. Ethereum Health Care management systems help to make appointments with specific doctors. 
As a doctor, we have many difficulties overseeing the patient's details. Doctors need a lot of time to check the patient's history in manuals. A doctor must go through all the reports and prescriptions of previous appointments. He needs to group by all the categories. This management system gives a bird's eye view of patient medical history categorically and based on the latest to oldest. 
There also included multiple features like searching for your doctor. From this module, a patient can get a brief knowledge about specialists. A general person or anyone can insert their opinion or query directly monitored and answered by the administration section. 
Now let's talk about the security features. All the usernames and passwords are directly connected to the Ethereum database. A person only can use this application if they are connected to the database and if and only if they have active status. This means after a particular time; the application admin module will be deactivated until the main database designer updates the status. 

Skills: Python, PySimpleGui, MYSQL, Django
